# Perfect Timing

## DESCRIPTION

Perfect Timing is an app that makes it simple for students to find optimal schedules for the courses they're taking. As students ourselves, we've had to face the struggles of researching courses and trying to create schedules that work. Perfect Timing automates this process. Simply enter your term, your courses, and your desired timeframe, and if one can be found, the best schedule will be given to you.
